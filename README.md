I've taken [@hakimel](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)'s great repository to build some self-brewed examples 

### Folder Structure
- **css/** Core styles without which the project does not function
- **js/** Like above but for JavaScript
- **plugin/** Components that have been developed as extensions to reveal.js
- **lib/** All other third party assets (JavaScript, CSS, fonts)
